# Theater Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project
An analysis on kickstarter projects based on previous kickstarter campaign data

### Purpose
This analysis is focused on finding information on theater projects funded by kickstarter with
the purpose of finding the optimal path to launching a successful project

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis is the best chance at launching a theater campaign on kickstarter would be to set a goal of $1000 to $5000
and begin the campaign in May

A challenge I encountered while working on this project were relative tables. While working on finding the percentage 
of successful/failed/canceled campaigns I found myself having to do extra work because I did not make a relative link to the
original kickstarter page. I could have easily copied the first column to the second and changed 1 criteria and saved time.
I fixed this while doing the second table and was able to copy it over, saving a lot of time and creating a more reliable table.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Launch Date](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Queach/kickstarter_analysis/main/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png "Launch Date")
Based on launch date, the best time to launch a campaign is in May, followed by June and then July in that order.
Launching a theatre campaign seems to be most succesful at the begining of summer/ end of spring.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcome and Goal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Queach/kickstarter_analysis/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png "Outcome and Goal")
Campaigns tend to fail the most between $45000 to $49999 followed closely at any campaigns with goals over $50000.
A surprising outcome is that campaigns with a goal of $35000 to $45000 have a fairly high percentage of success, this may be due to heavy advertisement or 
well known authors, projects, etc. Further analysis would be needed.
The most successful campaigns are ones with goals below $1000 but followed very closely by campaigns between $1000 to $4999

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion is that the best time to launch a campaign is in May or during the beginning of summer
The second conclusion is that it is a bad idea to launch a campaign during the start of winter in November/December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns are most successful when given a realistic goal, what a realistic goal means is different from campaign to campaign.
In this given data set, the best goal to set for a brand new campaign without any previous reputation would be $5000 or below.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation of this dataset is that how successful a campaign is, isn't necessarily based on things that can be easily described through data.
Two campaigns could have identical descriptions, goals, and dates but have different outcomes based on the quality of the campaign itself.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A possible graph and page we could create would be "amount funded based on campaign author" and limit it to the top 10 succesful campaigns as well as the bottom 10
succesful campaigns. It would give an insight to when goals and reached based on reputation.
